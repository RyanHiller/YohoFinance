# Yoho! Finance

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="frontend\src\images\yoho_finance2.png"></div>

This is a recreation (to the best of my ability) of the Yahoo! Finance [website](https://finance.yahoo.com/) made with the [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) stack. This project is entirely for education and research purposes only and, while intended to be fully functional, is not intended to be used commercially or to generate any amount of revenue.

This project is intended to have the same functionality as the Yahoo! Finance website. Due to my own limitations it will almost certainly be more beneficial to use the real thing, and this project should not be used for any kind of real-money investing. All design and functionality is the property of Yahoo!.

## Installation

Ensure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM then run `npm install` in both `frontend/` and `backend/` folders.

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
...
cd ../backend
npm install
```

## Usage

Currently the most effective usage is by following the instructions explained in the Development section below.

## Development

Ensure you've followed the Installation instructions above. Open two terminal windows/tabs and navigate to the `frontend/` and `backend/` folders in each tab and run `npm start`.

##### Terminal 1

```sh
cd frontend/
npm start
```

##### Terminal 2

```sh
cd backend/
npm start
```

You can also use a software like [Concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run multiple commands concurrently.
